Production

This is a very basic messaging app that aims to enable a business to have an internal office messaging app. It can function even if the users are on different networks, the server side off the code will just have to be hosted on some cloud computing platform for that.

Our problem solving approach included doing research about how socket objects and ports work and how to implement it and how to host a server and what the different cloud computing options are. With this research as background we then implemented our solution.
